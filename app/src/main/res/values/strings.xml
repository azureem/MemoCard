    <string name="title">Memory Match is a single-player card game where you aim to uncover pairs of identical cards. All cards are initially face down, and you need to use your memory to remember where each card is located. You click on two cards at a time, and if they match, they remain face up. The goal is to uncover all matching pairs in the fewest number of attempts.</string>
